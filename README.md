# vaso

A module to help develop experiments

## Install

This is a really simple module, so i'm not publishing on NPM. To use it, clone the repository and run `npm link`.

## Usage

`vaso` run the browser-sync server
`vaso create <folder name>` create a folder with a empty project
`vaso build` Build the js file

Put  `//js: <file>` inside the main.js file and that will be replaced with the file content
